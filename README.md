# PopularMovies
PopularMovies is an app that shows the user the current most popular or highest-rated movies. The movie sources come from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org). If you intend to download the project yourself, you will need to create a gradle.properties file with a property "TMDBKey", along with your API Key from TheMovieDB.
